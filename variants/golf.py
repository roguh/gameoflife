"""The Game of Life, reduced size.



The universe of the Game of Life is a grid of square cells, each of which is either alive ("#") or dead ("."). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    All other dead cells stay dead.
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    All other live cells die.

Given a 32Ã—32 grid, output the state in the next step. Assume that every cell outside the grid is dead.
